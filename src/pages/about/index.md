### Mission and Passion
For over 20 years I have dedicated my career to the growth and success of any organization both through leadership and engineering. Whether the company has 5 or 5000 employees, I pride myself in being able to quickly learn, adapt, and create a strategy to meet the needs of the project, the team, and the organization. I have extensive experience jumping into active projects and teams with a focus of improving efficiency and quality of output. Through adding team processes and working with stakeholders, the goal in all of my projects is to deliver actionable tasks to the developers and set appropriate expectations to all involved. Organizing the most effective team, choosing the right technologies, the proper application architecture, and implementing the necessary process to produce the right solution for the organization is my professional passion.

### Leadership
As a leader, I place emphasis on understanding the needs and goals of each member of my team. I strongly believe that maintaining a positive and productive attitude is crucial to a productive development team. By leading with this example, I cultivate teams who share an emphasis on support, collaboration, and collective improvement. Outside of project work, I love to offer the team skills improvement through tech talks, innovation projects, and short term goal setting. This has resulted in dedicated, devoted employees with a near flawless retention rate.

### Mission and Passion
In my free time I enjoy keeping current with emerging technologies through online course-ware and personal projects. I've recently started mentoring both through professional services and through my professional network. Working with up and coming developers to give them the tech and soft skills needed to land their dream job is extremely rewarding.
